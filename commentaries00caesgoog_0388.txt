As the usesulnesa os translations ol' the classica is universally allowed, so
the difficulty ol' succeeding iu them will be readily, granted by all who have eset
attempted it. Το translate a modern author of genius, into a modern languags,
iano easy taslr, though ao many ol the modern· languages resemble one aretham
, it must therefore be 'extremely difficult ιο translate any ol the classical writers ol

Greece or Rome into such alauguage as ours, the idioma and structure os which

not capable ol reading Sallust himself, and yct are desirous os being acquainted
