wonder that he should put on the appearance of this, as well aa of other virtues
But that clemency was nothis natural character, we have the express testimony of
his friend Curio, who well knew him ε Caelius too, one of hie partisans, freely says
of him, in a letter to Cicero,'that he meditated nothing but what was violent and
tragical, nor even spolie in any other strain.

As 'partiality has made Sallust boetow false colours upon the characteres Caesar,
so prejudice bas lrept him from placing that of Cicero in a clear and full light. He
represents him indeed as an active, sensible, and diligent magistrate, allows him the
character of an excellent consul, but bestows no greater degree of praise upon him,
than what could not well be diesembled by an historiam anderen what he says of
him does not seem to come directly from the beart. But was n'o more than this
scanty measure of praise due to the immortal Cicerof No greater tribute due from
an impartial historian to the saviour of hie countryl Was this doing full justice to
the superior abilinae, the undaunted contage, the unwearied diligence, and uneom·
'con sagacity, whereby Cicero baffled so desperate a conspiracy, and saved Rome
nom one of the greatest dangers that had ever threatened herl le it not the duty ·
of an lristorian to throtr distinguished lustre ou distinguished merit, and to brighten
the characteres anational delivererf ff so, then surely Sallust has fallen far short

- ’ of his, in the account he has given of Catiline's conspiracy, which for this reason

is a very defective performance.
Had Cacsar done what Cicero did, his conduct had been related in very different

strains, his praises copiously set before the reader, and his character represented in
the fullest light We should then have seen that maaterly address, wherewith both
senate and neople were managed; that dexterity and artful management, whereby
erdere of men, the most averse to each other, were united in the common interest
of their country ; and that vigilance, wherewith the secret machinatione of the con·

spirators were watchcd in silence, and a sufficient force prepared to resist thern.
before their black sclremes were laid before the senate, amply displayed, and finely
illustratcd‚ together with a full account of the extraordinary honours which were
the rewards of ench distinguished services.
