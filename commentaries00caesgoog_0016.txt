ntra OF cums sumus OAESAR. v

pius Gaulz aad Gallia Ulterior, or the southern part of Transalpino Gaul, also called
emphatically vaincia, whose capital was Narbo, now Narbonne. 'l'he Provincia
eatsuded from tha Mediterranean to the Cebenna mountaius, and included the modern
provinces of East Languedoc, Provenoe, and Dauphind. On the north it joined the
Allobroges, then lately subjected to Rome. When Cesar, in his Commentarios,
speaks of Gaul, which he divides into Aquitania, Celtica, and Belgica, he means the
Gaul which was theu independent, and which he conquered, exclusive of the Provincia
already subject to Rome. Ceeeur’s campaigns in Gaul, which are the most eventful
period· of his life, belong to the history ol Rome. They comprise the time from tha
beginning of B. C. 58 to B. C. 51. During this period he stopped the Helvetii, who
were emigrating from their native country,a part of modern Switzerlaud‚ with tha
intentiones aettlingiu the southern part of Gaul. He totally defeated Ariovistus,a
powerful German chief, with immense slaughter. Some of tha fugitives escaped
across tlte Rhine in boats, and Ariovistus among them. The two sons of Ariovistus
and one daughter were killed in tlte ssight, und another daughter was tahan prisoner.

The campaign of 57 Β. C. was against the Belgio Gaulo, a powerful raca of German
origin, who had been long settled in the country between the Rhine and the Sequana
(seins). 'Phe war was conducted with his usual vigour and success, though tha
resistance of some of the Belgio tribes, especialy the Nervii, was most desperate. ln
this campaign, Caesar adveneed north of the Axona, a branch of the Scine. Crassus,
theson of Crassus with whom Caesar had made acoslition, being detached by Caessr
across the Sequana intoWestern Gaul, received the submission of the Aulerci. Unelli,
and Veneti, and other maritime people on the coasts of the Atlantic3 and, as the sea·
son was growing late, the army went into winter-quartem in the country of the Car·
nutes, Turones. and other parts of Central Gaul. Coesar set off, according to his
enatem, for Cisalpine Gaul, where his friends floched from Rome to congratulate him
on his successes. The senate, on receiving from the victorious general the usual
official letters, ordered fifteen days of public thanlssgiving to the gods, a period never
granted before for any other general.

His third campaign, 56 Β. C.. was against the Western Ganls, of whom the Veneti
were 5 powerful commerciol, scafaring people, who had numerous ships in which they
traded with Britain and other countries. Hsving recovered from the alarm of Caesar'a
conquests, they arrested the officers of Crassus, and refused to give them up until
their own hostages were restored. All the neighbouring maritime tribes made common
cause with the Veneti. Ceasar immediately ordered galleys to be constructed ou the
Ligeris, aud sent also to collect ships on the coast of the Pictones and Sintones, who
were friends with Rome. He directed the sseet to attach the Veneti by saa, while hs
marched against them by land. Α great naval battle, which lasted all day, ended with
the destruction of the ssent of the Veneti, to the number of above two' hundred ships.
Caeaar put to death 511 the senators or chief men of the Veneti, aud sold the rest as
slaves. After the deleat of the Veneti, he marched against the Morini aud Menapii,
aad placed his troops for the winter among the Aulerci, Lexovii, dcc.

The following year, 55 Β. C, the campaign was carried on against the Germana
upon the Mosa and the Rhine, and they were defeated with great slaughter, probably
near Coblenz, at the junction of tha llloselle and the Rhine. After this battle, Caesar
constructed a bridge over the Rhine in ten days, when he marched across aud ravaged
the country of the Sicambri. He recrossed the Rhine after spending eighteeu days on
(lerman ground.

He next made his first expedition iuno Britain. 15 this year essars period d

govemrneut was exteuded for live years by a senatus consultum.
