able men of any age. Thongb a lover of pleasnre, and a man of licentioris habits, he
never neglecned what was a matter of business. Aa awritar and an orator, he has
received the highest preise from Cicer03 and his “ Commentaries,” written in a plain,
perepicnuus style, are e model of their kind. His projecte were vast and magnificent.
He reformed the Roman calendar, under the direction of Sosigenes. He established
public libreries, and gave to the learned Varro the care of collecting and arranging the
books. The three books of the ⁸· Civil Ware’‘ were written by Casan bnt the single
books on the Alexandrian, African, and Spanish ware, respectively, are generally
attributed to another hand. The fragments of various other werke of Cesar’ehave

'l'rru following translation of Caeeur’s Commentaries was done from the celebrates
edition of thalete Dr. clerks, printed for J. Tonsos, in 1712. all possible care hes
been taken to render it exact, and ιο preserve the distinctness eud perspicuity of
expression for which the original is so justly famous. The render will perceive that
the very turn and manner of Caesar have been copied with the ntmost attentiouz
and though the success may not always answer expectation, yet cendant will induce
him ιο make great ullowancee when he considers the inimitable beauty of tha Latin,
and the difficulty of expressing ancient manners and transactione iu modern language.
lt was at first intended ιο accornpany the translation with notes, explaining what was
difficolt and obscure iu the Roman nrt of war. But. ae a few loose, scattered remarks
would heo.» cantrihnted little toward giving the render a distinct idea ef what was
necessary ιο be known on this head, thore ie substituted iu their place a disconree con·
cerniug the military costerus of the ancients, in which all that isenricus and most
interesting relating to these matters is fully and copiously explained. Beeides the
ancient authors, Rollin, Folard, Orrery, Feuquiere. Machinvel, Montesqnieu, aud sev·
eral other moderna, huve been consulted. and all such passages selected as tended ιο
throw light upon this brauch of the Romen antiquitiee. As the author, by his situation
in life, ie necessarily a stranger to the practical part of war, he pretends not to offer
anything of his own upon the subject. If he has collected with care from the writers
before mentioned. and disposed the materiale they furnished, io ench a manner as suffi-
ciently ιο display the proficiency and improvements of the ancients in military knowl-
edge, be has compassed all he intended, and the render will heve no cause ιο complain. ‘
'I'he ancient nemea of places are retained in the translation, es wall to avoid giving too
modernatum to the author hya contrary practice, as because they are sufficiently
familiar to an English ear, being constautly made use of by all historiens who treet of
those times in our language. But, as the following work may perhaps fall into the
hands of persons little ecquaiuted with ancient geography-and who would, therefore,
be at a loss in comparing Caesar's descriptione with the present face of the country-
the reader will find at the end of the book a Geographicel Index, iu which the ancient
names of places, es near aa can be discovered with any certainty, are explained by the
modern. Ῑι may be just proper ιο mention. that besides the seven books of the Gallie
War, and the three of the Civil, written by Cesar himself, the Supplemente of A.
Hirtius Pansa are likewise inserted in the following translation, consisting of one
additional book to the Gallie war, and three books of tbe Alexandrian, African, aad
§punish Ware.
