ΤΗΕ LIFE OF SALLUST.

ψ

Carus Caresus Sanaosmos was born at Amiternum, in the country of the Sabinas,
in the year os Rome sin hundred and sixtyeigbt, during the third consulship ol 1.
Cornelius Cinna, and the first os Cu. Papirius Carbo. He was descended srom a
Plebeiau family, as appears srorn his having been one os the tribunes oi the people,
and srorn the many invectives against tlte nobility that are scattered up and down
his works. ln his carly years his inclination led him to the stndy os learning, to
which he applied with the greatest diligende, and rnade uncommon progress under
the care ol Atteius Praetextatus, odled Philologus, one oi the ablest grammarians
os the age.

lt appears that he had turned his thoughts, in his younger days, to tho wrrtrng
of history, sor which he had, unquestionably, great talents ς but, ae he himself in·
timates in his prel'ace to the History os Catiline’s Conspiracy, he was diverted srom
this pursnitby the workings ol' ambition. lt were to he wished, sor the salte ol
his character, that he had kept close to his original design, and not meddled with
the management os public adnm: his reputation would then have been free from
many os those stains with which itis now blemished. The Roman manners,
in the age wherein he lived, were extremely licentious and depraved; corruption
prevailed in the state, and the most harelaced venality in all the courts oi justice ς
the worthiest patriota, the best friends to liberty, suffered, while the basest parri·
eides were exalted; the Patricians and Plebeians were engaged in the most violent

struggles3 and as the one or the other happened to prevail, they oppressed the
opposite'party with wanton rage and iury: so that, considering the degeneracy oi
tue trnres, it is the less to be wondered at, il he caught the intention, and was
horne away by such a torrent os corruption.

ll' we may credit the ancient declainrer, who, underthe name oi Cicero, hu

inveighed against Sallust, his youth was stained with the lonlest acts ol' lewdnessr
' and indeed the gross enormities oi his more advanced years render it highly pro·
buhle. We are told by M. Varro, an author worthy of credit, that he was caught
ln adultery with Fausta, the daughter os Sylla, and severely whipped by her hns·
band Milo, who lilrewiss obliged him to paya considerable surn of money. 'l'hers
are other charges against him, heliam chiefly upon the authority of the abore·

mentioned declaimera bnt we shall not detain the render by enumerating thpm.
