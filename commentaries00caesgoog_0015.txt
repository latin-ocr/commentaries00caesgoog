the death of Comelia3 and Clodius, after being brought to a public trial for an offense
against religion, only escaped by bribing the jury. From motivas of policy, Caesar
did not break with Clodius: ha probably saw that he could make him a nseful tool
against Cicem.

The year 61 Β. C. was spent ογ Caesar in his province of Seuthem Spain, where he
apeedily restored order, and he hurried bach to Rome before his successor carne to can-
vaas for tha consulship. The aristocratical party saw that it was impossible to prevent
Ctesar's electiont their only chance was to give him a colleague who should bea
checlr upon him. 'I'beir choice of Bibulus was singularly unfortunate. Bibulus, after
unavailing eflhrts to resist the impetuosity of hia collengne, shut himself up in his
house, and Caesar acted aa sole consul, B. C. 59. He had contrived to render ineffec-
tual all oppositione on the part of hia opponente. Pompeius was dissutisfied because
the senate delayed about confirming all his mensures in the Mithridatic war and during

. his command in Asia: Crassus, who avus the richest man in the state, and second only

tc Pompey in inssuence with the senatorial fection, was not on good terma with Pom-
peius. lf Caesar gained over only rina of these rivale, ha made the other his enemy3
he determined, therefore, to secure them both. He began by courting Pompeius, and
succeeded in bringing abouta recrnrciliation between him and Crassus. It was agreed
that there should be a general understanding among the three as to the course of policy.
'Po cernent their alliance mora closely, Cesar gave Pompeius his daughter Julia in
marriage. He himself also toolr a new wife on tha occasion, Calpurnia, the daughter
of L. Piso, whom he nominated one of the consuls for the ensuing year, B. C. 58.
This union of Pompeius, Crassus, and Caesar, destroyed the credit of Pompeius, threw

disunion among the aristocrats, and put the whole power of the state into the hands of

one vigorous and clear-sighted man.

One of the most important mensures of Caesar's consulship was an agrarian law for
the division of some public lands in Campania among the poorer citizens, which was
carried by intimidation. Clodius, the enemy of Cicero, wus, through Caesar’s influence
aad the help of Pompeius, adopted into a plebeian family, and thus made capable of
holding the office of tribune. Clodius, the next year, was elected a tribune, and drove
Cicero into exile, B. C. 58.

'Phe Roman consuls, on going out of office, received the government of a province
for one year. Caesar’s opponente unsvisely made another effort against him3 they pro·
posed to give him the superintendence of the roads and foresta. Vatinius, one of hia
creatores, forthwitb procured alaw to be passed, ογ which he obtained for Caesar the
province of Gallia Cisalpina, or North Italy. and Illyricum, for five years; and the
senate, feuring the people might grant still more, not only confirmed the measure, but
added the province of Gallia Transalpina. “From this moment,” remarks ‚Schlosser
