LIFE OF CAIUS J ULIUS CAESAR.

Caius lunius Cassa, the son of C. J plius Cesar and Aurelia, was horr. Β. C. iot,
on the twelfth of Quintilis, afterward called Julius in honour of this Cesar. His aunt
J ulie was the wife of Caius Marius. In his serenteenth year he married Cornelia, the
daughter of Cinna, by whom he had a daughter, J ulia. This connection with Marius
and Cinna. the two great opponente of the dictator Sulla, exposed him to the resent-
ment of the opposite fection. Sulla is said to have spared his life with great reluc-
taire. He first served under M. 'l'hermus in Asia, aud distinguished himself at ths
capture of Mitylene (Β. C. 80 or 79). In the following year he served under Ρ. Ser·
vilius Isauricus in Cilicia. The news of Sullu's death brought him bach to Rome, .
B. C. 78. After his unsnccessful impeachment of Dolabella for maladministration in
his province, he retired to Rhodes, and for s time became the pupil of the rhetorician
Molo, whose instruction Cicero had attended, probably ayear or two before Coesar's
visit, B. C. 75. .

About B. C. 69, being elected one of the military tribunes, he procured an enactment
fu the restoration of L. Cinna, his wife's brother, und of those purtisans of Μ. Lepi·
dus who after his death had joined Sertorius in Spain. 'Phe following year he was
quaestorio Spain, and on his return to Rome, he was elected curule edile for B. C. 65.
The office of edile gave Cesar so oppormnity of indulging his teste for maguificeuce
and display, ny which he secured the favour of the psople. Cesarstwho was now
five-arid-thirty years of age, had enJoyed no opportunity of distinguishing himself ius
military capacity3 while Cn. Pompeius, who was only six years older, wass spreading
his name and the terror of the Roman arms throughout the Eust. By a judicioos
application of money among the poorer votens, and of personui influeuce among al
classes, he obtained the Pontificatus Maximus (B. C. 63), or headship of the pollege of
Pontifices, a place to which an official residence iu the Sacra Via was attached. This
union of civil and religions fonctions in the same person, at least iu the higher and more
profitabla places, was part of the old Roman polity.

At the time of the debate on the conspiracy of Catilina (B. C. 63), Coesar was pretor
designatus (pretor elect for the following year), aod accordingly spolie in his place in
the senate. He was the only person who ventured to oppose the proposition for pnt-

ting the conspiratura to death: he recommended their property to be confiscated, and ’

that they should be dispersed through the different municipia of Italy, aud kept under
a strict surveillance.

An affair which happened during his pretorship (B. C. 62) caused no little scandal
at Rome. While the ceremonias in honour of the Bona Dee were performing iu the
house of Cesar, at which women only could be present, the profligate P. Clodius, put·
ting on a woman’s dress, contrived to get admission to these mysterious rites. On the
affair being discovered, Cesar divoreed his wife Pompeia, whom he had married after¹
