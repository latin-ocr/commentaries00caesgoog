vl Luta OF CAIUS JULIUS oAEsntt.

'Phe next year, 54 B. C.. after making an excursion into Illyricum, ha returned
into Gaul, where ha had ordered a sseet to assemble at Pontius ltine for a second
attempt upon Britain. On his return from Britain, owing to the bad harvest and
scarcity of provisions, he dispersed his legions in various parts of the country for the
winter, a measure which proved nearly fatal to the Roman arms. He himself
remained in Belgic Gaul. 'l'he Eburones revolted and attached the camp of Titurius
Sabinus and 1.. Cotta, who had one legion and five cohorte with them. The Romane,
against Cotta’s opinion, made an effort to retire ιο the next Roman garrison, but they
were attached on their march and cut to pisces. The Ebumnes, under their king
Ambiorix, next attached the camp of Quintus Cicero, brother ιο the orator, who was
stationed with one legino in the country of the Nervii. Quintus made abrave defence,
and was finally relieved by Caesar. The following year, 5³ Β. C., which was the
tixth of his govemment, symptoms of general disallection manifested themselves
throughout Gaul. This was a year of desultory though destructive warfare. Caesar
crossed the Rhine again from the country of the Treviri. This movement led to ua
result, and he withdraw his army. He then ravagerl the country of the Eburones, and
having put his legions to winter among the Treviri, Lingones, and Senones, repaired
' ιο Cisalpine Gaul. The disturbaoces at Rome, in consequence of tha murder of P.
'Clonus made him turn his attention toward that quarter. He raised troops in every
part of the Cisalpine province. 'l'he Gauls now thought the time was come for one
great effora while Caesar was engaged in Italy. The Camutea massacred all the
Romans whom they found in the town of Genabum. Vercingetorix, a young man of
ona of the first families of the Arvemi was placed at tha head of a confederacy of the
whole of Celtic Gaul. Coesar, hearing the news, set off in the middle of winter for
Gaul north of the Alps, and ιοοο Vellaunodunum, Genabnm, and Noviodunum. Ha
also took Avaricum, garrisoued by tha Gauls. who made acourageous desence. But
the great event of this campaign was the siege of Alesia, now a village called Saint
Reine, und also Aliae, near flavigny, and Semur, in North Burgundy. For this cele·
brated siege we must refer ιο Caesar⁸s oum account. Cesar found himself besieged in
his own linea, having to fight Vercingetorix who had retired within the town, and tha
confederates from without. Alesia finally surrendered, and Vercingetorix, several
years later, wulhed before the triumphal car of the conqueror; after which he was put
ιο death in prison. Caesar’s eighth and last campaign in Gaul (51 Β. C.) is related by
Hirtius, who has continued his ‘Commentaries' by writing an eighth or supplementary
boolt. During the winter, which followed this campaign, he endeavoured ιο conciliate
the principal inhabitants of Gaul by rewards, and treated the peopla with hindness;
and, by rendering the Roman yolte light, he pacilied Gaul, exhausted by ita long and
unfortunate struggle. ln the spring 5013. C., ha setoil‘ for North Italy, where he
was received with great rejoicings. On hia return to Belgio Gaul, he reviewed hia
troops, and soon after returned to the north of Italy, where tha dissensione between
him and the senate had began which led to tha civil war. 'Phia was the ninth and
last year of Caaar's govemment of the Gauls.

Caesar's connection with Pompeius had dissolved by the death of J ulia without aoy
aurviving offspring, and by the gmwing jeaiousy with which hia success in Gaul and
hia popularity with his army had filled all the aristocratical party. His object now
was to obtain the consulship a second time, and a special enactment had been already

passed enabling him to stand for the consulship inhia absence. But Pompeius pre·
veiled upon the senate ιο require him ιο give up the command of the army and come
ta Ῑοοῐοο in person to be a candidata. Caesar, who was at Ravenna, in his province of
Gallia Cisalpina, sent Cario ιο Rome with a letter expressed in strong terma, in which
