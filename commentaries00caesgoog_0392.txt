magistracy 113 purchased a country-house at 'I'ivolh and one ο1 the noblest dwell·
ings in Rome on the Quirinal mount, with beautiful gardens, which to this day is
called the gardens ol Sallust. ln what manner he spen't the remainder ο1 his days,
we hove no account; he died in the year ο1 Rome setin hundred and nineteen. Ξ ὃ

Though Sallust's character as a man has beeu held in just abhorrence and dete
tation, as an historian 113 has been ever highly admired by the bestjudgea. His
talents for history were certainly very great; and where he persnas the thread ot‘
it, he does it in the most perspicuous, agreeable‚ and instructive manner: his style
is clear and nervous ς his narration natural; his descriptione beautisu13 his reflec-
tions curicus and solid; his speeches animated and persuasive; and his characters
just and striking. Alter all, he is not without his 1311113, and those very great ones.
He is very apt to‘start srom his subject, in order to display his own abilities, and to
run into dignensium, which, however ingenious and entertaining‚ have 311311 31 31·
1331311311 and sels-sufficiency. His vanity appears clearly in 1113 prelaces, which are
11111 os cornpliments to himsell ; and instead os being pertinent introductions to his '
history, seem rather desigued to represenl the importance os his own character and
studies. They abeund indeed with virtnons sentimenta, and bitter invectivae against
corrupt governors ; though these, by the way, seem rather to proceed lrorn privata
pique and reseutment‚ 111311 113111 3 genuine abhorrence ο1 corruption, or 3 truly pa·
triot aeal sor the public good.

His history os the war with Jugurtha is a masterly performance ; but his par·

· tiality to Caesar, aud his treatment ο1 Cicero, are unpardonable 1311113 111 the account x
ο1 Catiline'a conspiracy. Vl'hen he drawa the characters ol Cato and Caesar, he

considers thern only as two grem subjecta in the service ol a lree state, and acquir·
ing sams by different ways aud qualities3 without once mentiouing the most mate·
rial differeuce between them-that the one laboured earnestly, through the whole
31111133 ol his 1113,1ο preserve and reform the state, whilst the other did 311 111 his
power to corrupt and destroy it. Did we know nothing more of Caesar thau what
Sallust says 111 hirn, we should certainly 13113 his character lor agreat 3ηά amiable
oue. Bothe has only given 113 the 1311 side ο1 it, 11 11 may be properly said that it
hadone, without representing him in his true colours3 as the friend 3ηά patron ol
the abandoned, the depraved, aud desperate; as the promotores public abus'e and
corruption ; as one who took pleasure in embroiling 3ηά debauching the state ; and
as a monster ο1 ambitinn. He put on, indeed, 1113 guise ο1 clemency, sor which he
has bcen highly celebrated by his flatterers, 33 isit had been 3 real, nnd not an as·
sumed quality in him. But surely no one, who is acquainted with his character, will
assert, that he, who was guilty of the greatest crnelty in making war upon and eu·
slaving his country, would have relinquished his mad schemes os ambition, 11 gentle
methotls had 1311311111111, 1311131 1111111 have reoourse to acts ο1 blood and vangeanee.
